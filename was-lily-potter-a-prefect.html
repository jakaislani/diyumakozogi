<time>06 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><span><span><b>Lily was so impressive at her job as a Prefect</b> that she was eventually chosen to become the Head Girl during her time at Hogwarts.</span></span><h2>Was James Potter a prefect?</h2>Once a student became a prefect, they had a better chance of becoming Head Boy or Head Girl; however a student was not required to earn the former honour in order to earn the latter. This fact was exemplified in the knowledge that Remus Lupin was a Gryffindor prefect, but James Potter was later appointed the Head Boy.<h2>Who became Prefects in Harry Potter?</h2>One male and one female student are chosen from each house in their fifth year to act as prefects, and would continue to be prefects in their sixth and seventh years until they leave school. Thus, there are approximately six prefects per house, and twenty-four prefects in the whole school at one time.<h2>Who was the Slytherin prefect?</h2>We also see, in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, that Lucius Malfoy was a Slytherin Prefect when Severus Snape, James Potter, Remus Lupin, and Sirius Black first arrived at Hogwarts. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore mentions that Tom Riddle was also a Prefect.<h2>Why is Harry Potter not a prefect?</h2>He was in need of recognition and Dumbledore saw that. Conversely, Harry had more than enough recognition, and making him a prefect would've just been one more reason for people to have an opinion on him and his behavior. Dumbledore knew Harry didn't need more speculation or attention than he already had.<h2>The Life of Lily & James Potter (Harry Potter Explained)</h2><p></p><h2>Why was Ron named prefect?</h2>Dumbledore makes Ron a Prefect because he knows about his aspirations revealed by the Mirror of Erised. In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Ron sees himself in the Mirror of Erised as Head Boy, like his brothers Bill and Percy, Captain of the Quidditch team, and standing out among his brothers.<h2>Who was the Ravenclaw prefect?</h2>10 Penelope Clearwater. Penelope was a Ravenclaw Prefect best known for being the long-time girlfriend of Percy Weasley. As far as Prefects go, she didn't have a huge impact on the overall story importance but she was diligent.<h2>Who are the two new Gryffindor prefects?</h2>The only two confirmed Gryffindor students from that year were Cormac McLaggen and Katie Bell.<h2>How many owls did the Twins get?</h2>The twins may have only achieved three O.W.L.s each during their Hogwarts exams, but those boys were smarter in ways far deeper than the academic sense. When inventing, trialling and perfecting the various products they sold at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, for example, they proved they had more brain power than most.<h2>How strong is Lily Potter?</h2>Yet it's her time outside Hogwarts fighting Voldemort that really make Lily one of the most powerful witches of all time. Lily not only joined the war against Voldemort, she managed to defy him no less than three times. All the while giving birth to a son and raising a family.<h2>Does Hermione become a prefect?</h2>Ron and Hermione were Gryffindor Prefects in their fifth year. The following students are known Prefects: Gryffindor: Lily Evans.<h2>Does Hermione become Head Girl?</h2>After Voldemort's death, Hermione went back to Hogwarts to finish her studies, so she was probably the head girl that year.<h2>Does Ginny become Head Girl?</h2>Aside from Bill Weasley, his brother Percy is the only other member of the Weasley family to become a Head Boy. Some fans wonder if Ginny Weasley may have become a Prefect or Head Girl at one point, but it is never mentioned in the series.<h2>Why was Malfoy made a prefect?</h2>It was like Dumbledore's peer pressure to get him to do good. He was also trying to keep an eye on him. Draco could abuse his power, yes, but only so much as a prefect. He still had responsibilities and had to work with Snape, one would think.<h2>Who was Head Girl when Tom Riddle was Head Boy?</h2>The list of known Head Boys/Girls is as follows: Albus Dumbledore (mentioned in Deathly Hallows Chapter 18) Minerva McGonagall (mentioned in Wizarding World article) Tom Riddle (mentioned in Philosopher's Stone Chapter 17)<h2>Who is the most famous Hufflepuff?</h2><p>10 Most Famous Hufflepuff Characters in Harry Potter</p><ul><li>Hannah Abbott.</li><li>Fat Friar Ghost.</li><li>Teddy Lupin.</li><li>Cedric Diggory Triwizard Tournament.</li><li>Nymphadora Tonks.</li><li>Professor Pomona Sprout.</li></ul><h2>Is Mr Filch Professor McGonagall's son?</h2>The answer is: NO.<h2>Who is the heir of Gryffindor?</h2>Harry is the magical Heir of Gryffindor (and he's also a descendent of Godric), Neville of Hufflepuff, Hermione of Slytherin and Luna of Ravenclaw. (It was due to Dumbledore's manipulations that Neville and Hermione hadn't been put into the correct House.)<h2>How are prefects chosen?</h2>Prefects are awarded badges that identify them to staff, pupils and visitors. Pupils are selected for their ability to lead others and are, indeed, pupil leaders. Prefects must lead by example through exemplary good manners and behaviour; good citizenship and through correct wearing of the school uniform.<h2>Who was petrified by the basilisk?</h2>Known victims of Petrification<p>Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington — saw the Basilisk directly through himself, but, as a ghost, he could not die again. Justin Finch-Fletchley — saw the Basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick, who was transparent. Hermione Granger — saw the Basilisk through Penelope Clearwater's mirror.</p><h2>Who was Head Boy in Harry Potter's year?</h2>Hagrid has mentioned to Harry, in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, that Harry's father and mother were Head Boy and Head Girl while they were at Hogwarts. While there must be a Head Boy and a Head Girl in each year Harry attends Hogwarts, the only one we ever hear of is Percy.<h2>How much older is Percy than Ron?</h2>Bill is two years older than Charlie, who is three years older than Percy, who is two years older than Fred and George, who are two years older than Ron, who is a year older than Ginny.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9aaqmakmaHGbrzOraueql2WerG%2BxJ%2BcnKw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwas-lily-potter-a-prefect.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwas-lily-potter-a-prefect.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwas-lily-potter-a-prefect.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwas-lily-potter-a-prefect.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwas-lily-potter-a-prefect.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwas-lily-potter-a-prefect.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./will-meghan-markle-be-in-suits-la.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./will-meghan-markle-be-in-suits-la.html>Will Meghan Markle be in Suits: LA?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./is-one-day-appropriate-for-kids-one-day-parents-guide.html>Is One Day appropriate for kids?
