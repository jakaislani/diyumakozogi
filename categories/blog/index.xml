Low level languages give developers the chance to have very fast code with the minimum of commands necessary, but the closer you code to hardware the more difficult it becomes, and the developer should have a good grasp of the hardware in order to get the best performance. In theory, everything could be written in assembly language but that has some limitations. Programming languages, over time, have been abstracted from the hardware they run on which gives advantages to developers in that they do not have to micro-manage their code, and the code itself can be compiled against different architectures.</description></item><item><title>HBOs The Last of Us made one massive, shocking change from the game in its finale</title><link>/hbos-the-last-of-us-made-one-massive-shocking-change-from-the-game-in-its-finale.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/hbos-the-last-of-us-made-one-massive-shocking-change-from-the-game-in-its-finale.html</guid><description>Warning: The following article contains spoilers for The Last of Us season one finale, “Look for the Light.”

Last but certainly not least, we have our obligatory look at power, temperature, and noise. Next to price and performance of course, these are some of the most important aspects of a GPU, due in large part to the impact of noise. All things considered, a loud card is undesirable unless there’s a sufficiently good reason to ignore the noise.
It’s for that reason that GPU manufacturers also seek to keep power usage down, and under normal circumstances there’s a pretty clear relationship between power consumption, heat generated, and the amount of noise the fans will generate to remove that heat.</description></item><item><title>What Happened To Carl Lentz?</title><link>/what-happened-to-carl-lentz.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/what-happened-to-carl-lentz.html</guid><description>Introduction to Carl Lentz and His Rise to FameCarl Lentz was a prominent figure in the contemporary Christian community, known for his charismatic leadership and modern approach to ministry.

What’s the difference between a spare bowling ball and a spare bowling ball? One or more strike balls, as well as a spare. A “strike ball” is the main ball you’ll use on your first throw, and if that strike doesn’t come, you’ll reach for your trusty spare ball to help you pick up those tough spares.

及びにヴィジュアル系に革命を起こして、
伝説的バンドであるmalice mizer。
GACKTさんをボーカルに迎えていた時代は、
「これからメジャーで大暴れする！」と、
多くのファンが期待し、malice mizerの天下を夢見ていたことでしょう。
現在は活動が止まっているものの、
今でも多くの信者を抱え、
リーダーのManaさんを愛してやまない方が多いです。
malice mizerはステージのセットが、インディーズ時代から凝っており、
マナさんが自宅から家具を持ち出すなど、ライブが始まる前の準備に追われていたそうです。
そんなmalice mizerのトレードマークと言えるのが、
中世ヨーロッパの貴族をイメージしたような、
白塗りの人形のようなメイクです。
GACKTさんは王子様なのに対して、
リーダーのマナさんはお姫様のようなメイクをしていました。
今となって気になるのは、
malice mizerのメンバーのすっぴん、
特に一際美しかったマナさんのすっぴんですね。
malice mizerのManaのすっぴん。画像はない malice mizerのメンバーは、
ライブ以外のメディア活動でも、
濃い白塗りのメイクを施してました。
「笑っていいとも!」に出演した際にも、
濃いメイクでタモリさんを驚かせていました。
しかし、脱退したメンバーのテツさんは、
他の活動で堂々とすっぴんで活動していたり、
GACKTさんも、時よりすっぴんに近い姿を公開してます。
それでも、一番すっぴんが気になる、
リーダーのマナさんのすっぴんは一切公開されていません。
マナさんは、今の別の活動の中でも、
きっちとメイクを施しており、
ヴィジュアル的には全盛期と変わらない完成度を維持してます。
どこにもマナさんのすっぴんの画像はない・・・、
だとしても、過去のmalice mizer関連の本の中で、
インタビュアーがメンバーのすっぴんを見た感想などはあります。
malice mizerはメンバー全員が、
もともと男前で、すっぴんでも全然いけるバンドなのです。
特にマナさんとGACKTさんは、
顔の輪郭から目鼻の作りまで、
メイクをしてなくても整ってのはわかります。
これからマナさんのすっぴんを見てる機会来るのか・・・？
現在の年齢はいくつになるのでしょうか？
GACKTさんが既に４０歳を超えているので、マナさんもなかなかです。
今後、幾つになってもメイクをして活動を続けていくのか、
それとも、どこかですっぴんを公開する機会が訪れるのか、
今後もマナさんの動向には目が離せません！
malice mizerのkamiの生年月日と命日(お墓) malice mizer最大の悲劇といえば、
全盛期でのボーカルのGACKTさんの脱退です。
そして、その次に悲劇的だと言えるのが、
全盛期のドラマのkamiの死去です。
malice mizerの正規ドラマーとして活躍していたkamiさんですが、
１９９９年の６月２１日にくも膜下出血で急死し、
バンドに大きな大打撃を与えました。
