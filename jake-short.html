Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Jake’s net worth is estimated to be over <strong>$3 million</strong>, and if he stars in a series, he could earn up to $26,000 per episode. As he is assigned to multiple upcoming projects, including Teppo Airaksinen’s “Supercool,” in which Jake will play Neil, as well as “Confessional” and “This Is the Year,” his net worth will only grow.</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Jake_Short_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Jake Short born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>Jacob Patrick ‘Jake’ Short was born on<strong> May 30, 1997,</strong> in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA, under the sign of Gemini, and holds American citizenship. Growing up in a large family, he was constantly surrounded by relatives who loved and supported him. His mother, Kimberly Kennan Hankins Short, is a plastic surgeon, and his father, James Kramer Short, is an intensivist specializing in critical care.</p><p>Jake has two younger sisters, Gillian and Jessilyn Short, as well as an older brother, Austin James Short. The only thing known about Jake’s 2015 school is that it was in Indianapolis. Jake, on the other hand, did not attend college or university after graduating and instead went straight into the performing business.</p><h2><span id=Is_Jake_Short_Single_Relationship_Girlfriend>Is Jake Short Single?

The film depicted the life of model Anna Nicole Smith and was well-received by critics, so Jake was very fortunate to be cast in it because he immediately received another invitation.</p><p>He played Nose Noseworthy in the film “Shorts” in 2009, and Mookie in the TV film “Jack and Janet Save the Planet” the same year. Jake was full of energy and landed two more roles before the end of 2009: he appeared in the famous TV comedy “Zeke and Luther” episode “Bros Go Pro” and then portrayed Scott Smith in the very popular series “Dexter,” starring in episodes such as “Hello, Dexter Morgan”, “Lost Boys”, and “The Getaway”.</p><p>Jake’s role in “Dexter” raised his profile among numerous producers and filmmakers, and he began receiving additional offers. He played Tyler in the episode “The Other Side” of the TV show “Futurestates” (2010), Timmy in the episode “Goodson Goes Deep” of the TV film “$h*! My Dad Says” (2011), and Adam in the short film “It Is Dark in Here” (2011).</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":36992,"10":2,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/"}{"1":78}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a></span><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Maria Lucia Heiberg Rosenberg</a></h3>Maria Lucia Heiberg Rosenberg estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
