This is reality. That’s right, your favorite Costco superfan went deep undercover at Sam’s Club. I do what I must to get the best info for you, and there’s also no one at Sporked who’s better equipped to guide you toward what to buy at Sam’s Club if you’re shopping for one. I put together a similar list for <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/what-to-buy-at-costco-if-youre-single/>single Costco shoppers</a>, and that list was all about the variety packs. This list is a little different because I found a bunch of things that come in smaller quantities—Sam’s Club is actually a pretty clutch place to find deals even if you aren’t shopping for a family of five. Living alone doesn’t mean price clubs are a no-go! Here are the best things to buy at Sam’s Club if you’re single.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jimmy Dean Sausage, Egg & Cheese Croissant Sandwich</strong></a><p>I absolutely love breakfast, but I typically can’t bring myself to cook up a full a.m. spread before I have to hop online for my 9 to 5. These croissant sandwiches seem like a good middle ground between waking up two hours early to cook and do dishes for a breakfast for one and having the same bowl of oatmeal every day until I die. Worried about finding space in your apartment’s less-than-ample freezer? These are individually wrapped so you can ditch the box and cram them wherever you find space.</p><p>Read the full ranking of the best breakfast sandwiches</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Velveeta Shells & Cheese</strong></a><p>There is something very “single and live in mom’s basement” about buying mac and cheese. There shouldn’t be, though! I’ll die on this hill. Own it! Mac and cheese is damn good and I’m sick of pretending it doesn’t hit the spot when you don’t want to cook an intricate meal at the end of a long day. And Velveeta is elevating the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-boxed-mac-and-cheese/>boxed mac and cheese</a> game, big time. As one Sporked contributor wrote, this stuff is “creamy, smooth, buttery, and delicious.” If you’re reading this list because you’re wondering what to buy at Sam’s Club if you’re single, a box of eight should last you a while—but we certainly won’t judge if you have to go back next week for more.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-boxed-mac-and-cheese/>best boxed mac and cheese</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Barber Foods Cordon Bleu Stuffed Chicken Breasts</strong></a><p>Why did I think Chicken Cordon Bleu was the height of luxury eating as a child? No matter. Sophisticated or not, making cordon bleu from scratch is a pain (I tried it once and I will never try again), but a six-pack of individually wrapped breasts are perfect for six easy meals for one. Stuff these stuffed breasts in your freezer and forget about them until you need a quick and easy main for dinner. These are an easy choice—and not too much of a commitment for the solo Sam’s Club shoppers out there.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>OH SNAP! Dilly Bites</strong></a><p>There’s a precious art to the bachelor fridge that should be preserved. I’m not here to replace the jar of pickles that seems to permanently live alongside a few bottles of BBQ sauce and one stray yogurt cup. These pickles are here to expand your pickle options, not shrink them. As Sporked’s Jordan Myrick put it in their ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-dill-pickles/>best dill pickles</a>, these are snacking pickles without the mess. Don’t want to dirty a fork to dig a pickle out of the big jar at 3 a.m.? Grab these babies instead. These are perfect for bringing along on a solo movie date, too. Get a 12 pack of Dilly Bites from Sam’s Club, renew your AMC Stubs A-List membership, and go buck wild!</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-dill-pickles/>best dill pickles</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Member’s Mark Cheesecake Miniatures</strong></a><p>Buying an entire <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-cheesecake/>cheesecake</a> for yourself is wild. I mean…I’ve done it before, but I do admit it was a wild choice. Buying a box of 63 little cheesecake bites, on the other hand? Totally reasonable. We’re livin’ single the decadent way, baby. This box of Member’s Mark cheese cake minis comes with three flavors—New York style, caramel chocolate chip, and strawberry swirl—and they come frozen so you don’t feel obligated to eat an entire cheesecake in a week. This is a much better way to get your cheesecake fix.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Member’s Mark Lemon Blueberry Cookie Thins</strong></a><p>There’s an unsung beauty in the “big enough that it does feel like you’re buying in bulk but not so large you’ll be eating this until the day you die and your cats eat your face off” options at a bulk store. My eyes landed on this bag of cookie thins from Member’s Mark. It’s still a pound of lemon blueberry cookies, but they’re small enough that I could easily grab a few handfuls throughout the day and get through this bag in no time. I love that for us singles. Let’s throw it in the cart.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Fresh Creative Foods Gyro Express Meal Kit</strong></a><p>An absolute necessity for any shopping trip, whether at your local grocery store or a bulk operation like Sam’s Club, is an easy dinner option for when you get home. You just put all that work into shopping—you can’t possibly toil over dinner now! This meal kit looks like a yummy and stupidly simple solution to this problem. Toss the cold foods you just bought into the fridge and let the rest sit on the counter while you throw together some gyros and enjoy the fruits of your labor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFuwM5mma6xXZbBbr%2FApqpmm5yqr261xWawqK2imnq0tc2go55n</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-to-buy-at-sams-club-if-youre-single.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-to-buy-at-sams-club-if-youre-single.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-to-buy-at-sams-club-if-youre-single.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-to-buy-at-sams-club-if-youre-single.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-to-buy-at-sams-club-if-youre-single.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-to-buy-at-sams-club-if-youre-single.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-do-designers-use-tonal-shading-on-their-sketches-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-do-designers-use-tonal-shading-on-their-sketches-html.html>Why do designers use tonal shading on their sketches?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-are-the-6-types-of-observation.html>What are the 6 types of observation?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-are-the-6-types-of-observation.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
