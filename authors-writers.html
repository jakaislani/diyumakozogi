Her best-known works include the novels The House of the Spirits and City of the Beasts. She has written over 20 books that have been translated into more than 35 languages and sold more than 67 million copies.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Isabel Allende was born on August 2, 1942, in Lima, Peru, to Tomás and Francisca Allende. She is the goddaughter of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/salvador-allende data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Salvador Allende" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Salvador Allende</a>, the first socialist president of Chile who was her father's cousin. Her father, a diplomat, deserted the family when Allende was just two. She, her siblings and mother then moved in with her grandfather in Chile. Allende remembers herself as a rebellious child during those years living with her grandfather. “We lived in an affluent house – with no money," she said in an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/authorinterviews/10589928/The-incredible-life-of-Isabel-Allende.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Telegraph" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Telegraph</a>. "My grandfather would pay for what was necessary but my mother did not even have the cash to buy us an ice cream. I wanted to be like my grandfather because my mother had a terrible life and he had all the privileges and the power and the freedom and the car – I think that was the moment I started to rebel against all male authority: the police, the church, everything."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Her mother remarried to Ramón Huidobro, also a diplomat, and the family moved often as his posts changed. Allende said she was determined to work as a young woman and started her writing career as a journalist. She became a prominent journalist working in television and for magazines in the 1960s and 1970s.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Literary Work</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Allende's life was forever changed when General <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.biography.com/people/augusto-pinochet-9441138 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Augusto Pinochet" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Augusto Pinochet</a> led a military coup in 1973, toppling Salvador Allende's government. During an attack on the presidential palace Salvador Allende was shot and killed. (After decades of controversy surrounding the cause of his death, an autopsy confirmed in 2011 that it was a suicide.) Isabel Allende became active in aiding victims of the repression and brutality of Pinochet's regime, but realizing it was dangerous to stay in Chile, she fled the country with her husband and two children in 1975 and lived in exile in Venezuela for 13 years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1981, Allende began writing a letter to her grandfather, who was dying in Chile. The letter became the basis for her first novel, The House of the Spirits (1985), which became a worldwide bestseller and launched her literary career. The novel tells the story of two families living in Chile from the 1920s until the 1973 military coup, weaving together elements of magical realism and political testimony. Some of her works include Of Love and Shadows (1987), Eva Luna (1987), Two Words (1989), The Infinite Plan (1991), Daughter of Fortune (1999), Portrait in Sepia (2000), Zorro (2005), Ines of My Soul (2006), Island Beneath the Sea (2010), Maya's Notebook (2011), Ripper (2014) and The Japanese Lover (2015).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the urging of her three grandchildren, Allende wrote her first book for young adults, City of the Beasts, which was published in 2002. It was the first book in a trilogy for young readers, which also included Kingdom of the Golden Dragon (2003) and Forest of the Pygmies (2005).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The author calls her writing style "realistic literature, rooted in her remarkable upbringing and the mystical people and events that fueled her imagination," according to her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.isabelallende.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=website class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">website</a>, She also explains that her work is "equally informed by her feminist convictions, her commitment to social justice, and the harsh political realities that shaped her destiny."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to fiction, Allende has mined her own life to write deeply personal memoirs, including Paula (1994) about the life and loss of her daughter to a rare disease; Aphrodite: A Memoir of the Senses (1998), her ode to food and sex; My Invented Country: A Nostalgic Journey Through Chile (2003) about her early life and the inspirations of her personal history; and The Sum of Our Days: A Memoir (2008) about her life following the death of her daughter.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Awards</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During the course of her career, Allende has received numerous awards for her work including the Chilean National Prize for Literature (2010) and the Library of Congress Creative Achievement Award for Fiction (2010). In 2014, President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/barack-obama data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Barack Obama" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Barack Obama</a> presented Allende with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Allende married her first husband, Miguel Frías, in 1962. They had two children, Paula (born in 1963) and Nicolás (born in 1966). After her divorce from Frías in 1987, Allende met and married her second husband, Willie Gordon, a lawyer and writer, in 1988, but after 27 years together, they too divorced in 2015.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During their marriage, the couple endured the heartbreaking death of two of Gordon’s children from a previous relationship, as well as the passing of Allende's daughter Paula, who died from complications of a rare disease, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/02/isabel-allende-interview-marriage-breakup-the-japanese-lover data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=porphyria class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">porphyria</a>, in 1992 at the age of 28. Allende established the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.isabelallendefoundation.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Isabel Allende Foundation" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Isabel Allende Foundation</a> in Paula's honor. The foundation strives for economic and social justice for women.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Allende has lived in the San Francisco Bay Area since 1987, and became a U.S. citizen in 1993. She says on her website that remains connected to her adopted home and her birthplace living "with one foot in California and the other in Chile."</p><ul data-node-id=22 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Isabel Allende</li><li>Birth Year: 1942</li><li>Birth date: August 2, 1942</li><li>Birth City: Lima</li><li>Birth Country: Peru</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Chilean author Isabel Allende is renowned for writing international bestsellers including 'The House of Spirits,' 'City of the Beasts,' 'Inés of My Soul' and 'Paula.'</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Journalism and Nonfiction</li><li>Fiction and Poetry</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Leo</li><li>Nacionalities</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=25><ul data-node-id=27 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Isabel Allende Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/isabel-allende</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: November 12, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYrqyYpL%2B0edaroK2doqh8qr%2FAm5ylZZGhuaa6w54%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fauthors-writers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fauthors-writers.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fauthors-writers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fauthors-writers.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fauthors-writers.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fauthors-writers.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./one-night-in-bangkok-movie-review-2020.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./one-night-in-bangkok-movie-review-2020.html>One Night in Bangkok movie review (2020)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./is-josh-emmett-christian-ufc-fighter-religion-ethnicity.html>Is Josh Emmett Christian?
