She hoped for trans rights worldwide and bid farewell.</p><p>Her partner, known on Twitter as Parker, mourned her loss and promised to carry her memory with him for the rest of his life.</p><p>She stated, <strong>“I wanted to be a leader for people like me, but that wasn’t written to happen. I hope that the world gets better for us. I hope our people get old. I hope we get to see our kids grow up to fight for us. I hope for trans rights worldwide.”</strong></p><p>Knight’s family members confirmed her death on a Twitter account, which has since been made private.</p><p>The LGBTQ+ <a href=#>community</a> was deeply saddened by the suicide of transgender woman Eden Knight, and many <a href=#>social media</a> users called for justice using the hashtag <strong>#JusticeForEden.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It also illustrates the importance of protecting the rights and freedoms of marginalized communities, including LGBTQ+ individuals, and providing support and resources for those who are struggling.&nbsp;</p><p>The loss of Eden Knight is a tragedy that must not be forgotten, and her memory should serve as a reminder of the ongoing fight for equality and justice.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCxw56lZqOenrSpwIydnJqsmGLBs63NrJ6eppSav27DzqaYp2WTpLqutdOsZKytmZi2pbGO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feden-knight-death-transgender-woman-commits-suicide.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2feden-knight-death-transgender-woman-commits-suicide.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2feden-knight-death-transgender-woman-commits-suicide.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2feden-knight-death-transgender-woman-commits-suicide.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feden-knight-death-transgender-woman-commits-suicide.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feden-knight-death-transgender-woman-commits-suicide.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jasmin-savoy-brown-boyfriend-is-jasmin-savoy-brown-in-a-relationship.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jasmin-savoy-brown-boyfriend-is-jasmin-savoy-brown-in-a-relationship.html>Jasmin Savoy Brown boyfriend: Is Jasmin Savoy Brown in a relationship?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./danny-greene.html>Danny Greene - Family, Crimes &amp;amp; Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./danny-greene.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
